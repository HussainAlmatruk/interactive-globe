# Interactive ASCII Globe

A fully interactive, rotating ASCII globe that runs directly in your terminal, written in Python.



## About The Project

This script renders a 3D globe using ASCII characters based on a 2D map projection. It features smooth, flicker-free animation and allows you to control the globe's rotation in real-time. It's a fun demonstration of 3D projection math and terminal animation techniques.

### Features
* **Real-time Interaction**: Spin and tilt the globe using keyboard controls.
* **Flicker-Free Rendering**: Uses ANSI escape codes to provide a smooth animation without clearing the screen.
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux terminals.
* **Zero Dependencies**: Runs with a standard Python installation, no external libraries needed!
